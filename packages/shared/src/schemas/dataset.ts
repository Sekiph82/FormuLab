/**
 * FVL-05.001 — dataset schema version + feature schema version.
 *
 * Two independent version identifiers for the future Historical Experiment
 * Dataset Builder (FVL-05.002 onward): the DATASET schema versions the
 * shape of a dataset ROW (lineage + extracted fields, FVL-05.002-.008),
 * and the FEATURE schema versions the shape of a derived FEATURE VECTOR
 * (normalization + target-variable definitions, FVL-05.009-.010). They
 * change on independent timelines — adding a new extractor field bumps the
 * dataset schema without touching the feature schema, and changing a
 * normalization rule bumps the feature schema without touching the
 * dataset schema — so they are deliberately two separate literals, never
 * one shared "schema version".
 *
 * Each is a literal, not a free-form string, matching the existing
 * `schemaVersion: z.literal("1.0")` convention every other record schema
 * in this package already uses (e.g. `schemas/doe.ts`). Bumping either
 * constant here is the explicit, deterministic signal a future FVL-05
 * migration step (`engine/migrations.ts`'s `SchemaMigration.fromVersion`/
 * `toVersion`) would key off, exactly as that module already does for
 * other collections.
 *
 * This module defines the two versions only — not the dataset row shape,
 * the feature vector shape, or any extractor/normalizer. That is
 * FVL-05.002 onward.
